# Game Mechanics
## Core Gameplay Loop
The player runs forward along bustling Nigerian roads, swerving across 3 lanes, jumping over barriers and sliding under obstacles while spelling words by collecting flying letters.

With the **Police Quick-Time Threat & Lane Change Mechanic**:
1. **Periodic Threat Trigger**: While running, after a configurable interval (e.g. every 12–20 seconds), a police pursuit threat event begins.
2. **Warning & Direction Indicator**:
   - The police siren ramps up into urgent rapid wails.
   - The police cruiser accelerates directly into the player's current lane right behind them (within ~3m).
   - A pulsing warning alert appears on screen (e.g., "SWIPE TO CHANGE LANE!" with animated left/right warning chevrons / countdown bar showing the remaining reaction window: `X` seconds, configurable, e.g. 2.0 to 2.5 seconds).
3. **Player Evades (Success)**:
   - If the player swipes left or right to change into another lane before time expires:
     - The police cruiser roars forward past the player's old lane or screeches past and falls back into trailing position.
     - A quick "CLEAN DODGE!" / "+BONUS" flash triggers, rewarding the player.
     - Siren calms down to normal trailing level.
4. **Player Fails to Change Lane (Busted / Hit)**:
   - If the timer hits 0 and the player is still in the same lane:
     - The police cruiser rams the player from behind at full speed.
     - Triggers runner knockback / fall animation (`HitObstacle()`) and game over fail sequence with tire screech and loud crash sound.

## Controls and Input Methods
- Swipe Left / Right (or Left/Right Arrow / A/D): Change lanes before the countdown expires to avoid being hit from behind.

# UI
- **Lane Threat Overlay (Canvas_HUD)**:
  - Warning banner: "POLICE BEHIND! CHANGE LANE!" with red/blue flashing header.
  - Directional swipe indicator arrows (showing which lanes are available: Left, Right, or Both).
  - Circular or horizontal countdown bar indicating the time left (e.g. 2.5s -> 0s).
  - Cleanly auto-hides when evading or resetting.

# Key Asset & Context
- Existing Police Audio: `Assets/Resources/Audio/Police Siren .wav`
- Existing Police Cruiser: `Assets/Prefab/Vehicles/PoliceCruiser.prefab` with `PoliceChaserController.cs`
- Player Controller: `Assets/Script/SimplePlayerController.cs` (`currentLane`, `HitObstacle()`, `isMoving`, `MoveLane()`)
- HUD UI: `Canvas_HUD` managed in `UImanager.cs`

# Implementation Steps
1. **Extend `PoliceChaserController.cs`**:
   - Add Lane Threat state machine:
     - Configurable countdown duration `threatReactionTime` (default 2.5s).
     - Configurable interval between threats `minThreatInterval` (14s) and `maxThreatInterval` (22s).
     - `StartThreat()`: locks onto player's current lane, zooms to close proximity (~2.8m), triggers HUD warning.
     - `OnPlayerChangedLane(int newLane)`: detects if player left the targeted lane in time; triggers dodge reward, cruiser brake/pass, and resets to trailing.
     - `ThreatTimerExpired()`: if player failed to change lane in time, accelerates directly into runner position, calls `playerController.HitObstacle()` and triggers `TriggerBusted()`.
   - Dependency: Existing `PoliceChaserController.cs` and `SimplePlayerController.cs`.

2. **Add Lane Threat Warning UI (`PoliceThreatUI.cs`)**:
   - Create a lightweight HUD overlay component on `Canvas_HUD` or instantiated dynamically under the HUD.
   - Visual elements:
     - Warning title text ("CHANGE LANE!").
     - Countdown progress bar / radial fill showing `X` seconds remaining.
     - Left / Right directional indicator arrows telling the player which way to swipe (e.g. if in left lane, points Right; if in right lane, points Left; if center, points Both).
   - Dependency: Step 1.

3. **Wire Event Hooks in `SimplePlayerController.cs`**:
   - In `MoveLane(int direction)`, notify `PoliceChaserController.Instance.OnPlayerLaneChanged(currentLane)`.
   - In `TriggerFall()` / `HitObstacle()`, cancel any ongoing threat timer.
   - In `SetRoadsideIdlePose()` / `StartRunning()`, start/stop threat timers cleanly.
   - Dependency: Steps 1 and 2.

4. **Audio & Visual Polish**:
   - Police siren pitch / volume spikes when threat is active.
   - Screen shake or subtle red border vignette during the countdown.
   - Crash impact sound when rammed from behind.
   - Dependency: Step 3.

# Verification & Testing
- Enter Play Mode and start running.
- Verify normal trailing behavior for the first ~15 seconds.
- Verify threat event triggers: police car rushes close behind runner, warning UI shows countdown ("CHANGE LANE!").
- Test Success path: Swipe to an adjacent lane within the countdown; verify police car falls back, bonus/dodge message triggers, and threat ends.
- Test Failure path: Stay in the same lane until countdown expires; verify police car rams runner from behind, trigger fall animation, and game over screen appears.
- Test Edge cases: Pause game, hit an obstacle before threat expires, return to menu, and verify timers and UI reset cleanly.
